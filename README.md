## First Project 

### Lap-1 : "setup.py" was created! 
First we have Created the Setup.py file , requirements.txt, README.md and src files.
-e . is used in the end of the list of requirements.txt to 
include all the files in the current directory alaso we can build
it will automatically trigger the setup.py file and build the package 


### Lap-2: Creating Folder Structure 
We can create files or say directries manually one by one or we can create an template file to automate the process. 
We can Do this by two methods:
>creating "template.py" file which includes all the directories and sub directores adn its corresponding file.
> we can use cookie cutter to create the same process
